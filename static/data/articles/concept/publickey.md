## Asymmetric Encrption  
	
 Used in one to many trasition.
	
#### Public key & Private key   
     
We can see public key as a your own lock, and private key as your own key which can open the lock.    

1. Then, if someone want to send message to you, you send your lock to them. So they can encrypt their message using your lock.
You have the key, so you can decrypr. But others don't.

2. If you want to send message to others, you have to get their public key. Then do the same, encrypt the message using their public key.


## Symmetric Encryption    

Although asymmetric encryption can used for one to many trasition and is secure. It's efficiency is not that good.   
So combining both the symmetric and asymmetric encription is nowadays how we transimit data.
Baiscly, use the asymmetric encryption to transmmit the key for which is used for the symmetric encryption.
