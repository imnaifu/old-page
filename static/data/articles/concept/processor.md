1. 32 bit processor means can process 32 bit (4 byte) of data/command at one time   
under the same frequency, more bit means more speed
    - command is actually number of bits, which are from ISA (instruction set architecture) 指令集
2. It also mean the maximum locaiton of RAM is 4G 2 to the power of 32
