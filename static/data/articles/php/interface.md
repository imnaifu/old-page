### Interface
is used to restrict the class   
For example, If you want drive a car, there are many brand for you to choose.   
But, they all using the same interface so you can drive all of them in a same way (with little difference)   
Here the same interface means like they must have four wheels, must have one steering wheel. Something like that.    
So, the interface is to tell the class which 'implement' the interface must have method which defined in the interface.   
It's a restriction.

### Abstract Class
It's a class actually, but you can define abstract method, then it will be very like the interface.   
Because absract method is also a 'must-to-be-defined' method for the child class.
